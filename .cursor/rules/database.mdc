- After every changes, update documentation in /documentation/database-schema
- Never use ALTER TABLE statements when modifying database schema
- Since the app is in development and the database is reset frequently, always update the table creation scripts directly in the migration files
- When making schema changes, modify the CREATE TABLE statements in the appropriate migration file under /supabase/migrations/
- This ensures that when the database is reset, all changes are properly applied
